Can you remove blah.txt?

    rm blah.txt




Let's get rid of our development log file.

    rm development.log


Can you remove everything in the slash temp slash foo directory?
    
    rm -rf /tmp/foo


rm -rf / will recursively force remove every file starting at the root directory and is thus a bad idea.
